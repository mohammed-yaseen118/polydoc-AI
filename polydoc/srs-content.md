## Abstract

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document presents the comprehensive requirements analysis for **PolyDoc**, an innovative multi-lingual document understanding and layout preservation system designed to address the growing challenges in intelligent document processing across diverse linguistic contexts. PolyDoc represents a significant advancement in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies, specifically engineered to handle underrepresented languages such as Hindi and Kannada alongside English, while maintaining the structural integrity and formatting of original documents during the extraction and analysis process.

The system leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence models, including HuggingFace Transformers and state-of-the-art vector-based semantic search technologies, to provide a comprehensive suite of document processing capabilities. These include automated text extraction from multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, images), intelligent document summarization, real-time conversational interfaces for document interaction, and advanced search functionalities that understand semantic context rather than relying solely on keyword matching. The architecture follows modern microservices principles, utilizing FastAPI for robust backend services, React for responsive frontend interfaces, and MongoDB with GridFS for scalable document storage and management.

What sets PolyDoc apart in the contemporary landscape of document processing solutions is its specific focus on preserving document layout while processing multi-lingual content, particularly addressing the technical challenges associated with Indian regional languages that often lack comprehensive digital processing support. The system is designed with accessibility and usability in mind, catering to diverse user groups including academic researchers, business professionals, students, and government officials who require efficient processing of documents in multiple languages. By implementing free and open-source AI models, PolyDoc ensures cost-effective deployment while maintaining high performance standards, with processing capabilities that can handle concurrent document operations and provide real-time feedback through WebSocket communications. This SRS document establishes the foundation for a system that not only meets current document processing needs but also provides a scalable architecture for future enhancements in the rapidly evolving field of document intelligence and multi-lingual NLP applications.
